        I have never wished and hoped<br>
        Didn't need a telescope<br>
        To see where I am going<br>
        I have never been the one<br>
        Trying hard to hold my tongue<br>
        Is my stereo<br>
        <br>
        At one day I'll stand with a crown on my head<br>
        Like a God, yeah, like a God<br>
        With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want<br>

        I wanna be like Kanye<br>
        I'll be the king of me always<br>
        Do what I want, I'll have it my way<br>
        All day like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah<br>
        Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah<br>
        Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah<br>
        I'll be the king of me<br>
        <br>
        Born in broken home, okay<br>
        Single mama, let me chase what I was made for<br>
        We made out to Paradise,<br>
        Build on nickels, rubbing dimes<br>
        I'm entitled to so much more<br>
        <br>
        One day I'll stand with a crown on my head<br>
        Like a God, yeah, like a God<br>
        With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want<br>
        <br>
        I wanna be like Kanye<br>
        I'll be the king of me always<br>
        Do what I want, I'll have it my way<br>
        All day like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah<br>
        Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah<br>
        Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah<br>
        I'll be the king of me<br>
